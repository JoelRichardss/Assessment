                            <p>An axial typographic design means that the type is on an axis.To achieve this affect, I
                                used the rotation tool and changed the sizes of the font. I also added colours to some
                                of the key bits of text so they would stand out. Additionally, I added green rectangles
                                to help border the text.</p>

                            <p>For a Grid typographic design the text fits into columns or rows.So I put the text into
                                smaller sections and aligned them into a grid shape by putting the text into columns and
                                rows.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>In a bilateral typographic design the type is symmetrical or centered.I divided the text
                                into three different sections. Two smaller boxes were placed one at the top and bottom
                                of the page, and one larger main box was positioned in the middle. I did this to make it
                                symmetrical. Then, I made sure that the text boxes were centred.</p>

                            <p>There is a central focal point, and the text radiates out from that point.To achieve the
                                radial effect, I added a circle to the bottom left of my canvas. Then, I positioned the
                                text around it and changed the length of the text so it would be radiating from the
                                circle.</p>

                            <p>Modular layouts use repeating structures to break up the content.I used a repeating
                                structure by separating the text into boxes I made six boxes in total four of them the
                                same size and positioned them on the left and right I also added two to the top and
                                bottom of the page that were different sizes. </p>

                            <p>In a Random typographic system the font size and placement is random.I did this by
                                chaning the size of the font and the postion I used the type on a path tool to add a
                                more interesting and random layout of the text I also added random sections of colour as
                                well. </p>

                            <p> Dilatational designs use type set along circular paths.To make the type Dilatational I
                                drew circles and then used the type on a path tool i used colour to highlight the key

                                    transitioning from one point to another.To do the transitional typographic system I
                                    drew lines and used the type on a path tool i made sure that the lines were
                                    transitioning from one part of the canvas to another so the type would flow. </p>

                            <p>This was the first draft I did used contrasting colours pink and greens as well as
                                contrasting font sizes and styles I aligned the text around the skateboard and around
                                the contrasting pink elements which I repetitively used on this poster I incorporated
                                proximity by separating the title and the information.</p>

                            <p>This is my final project and the one that I refined, for the title I used the font style
                                Portobello, and to achieve the 3d effect of the title I used Illisator to inflate the
                                text then, I added the leather texture to it I changed the colour to orange to stand out
                                and contrast the green I alined the some of the type in the negative space of the image
                                in between the building and around the person in the image. I used the type-on-a-path
                                tool to add the type onto the top of a building as well as around the person's
                                skateboard. I mostly used a repetition of colour I used the colour green throughout it
                                which matches some of the trees in the poster and the person's shoes to highlight some
                                of the text I used a sandy colour that matches the person's clothes. </p>

                                some contrast to it by having the type at the bottom of the page and the title in
                                different sizes colours and styles I aligned the type to be around the person I used

                                file I used border and padding as well as some flex box. I also linked the HTML

                                an image on the page and added anchor links.

                                page changed the colour scheme by using Adobe colour wheel and added a
